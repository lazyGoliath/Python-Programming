# The algorithm is based on the below facts :
# If we subtract a smaller number from a larger one (we reduce a larger number),
# GCD doesnâ€™t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we
# end up with GCD.
# Now instead of subtraction, if we divide the larger number, the algorithm stops
# when we find the remainder 0.
